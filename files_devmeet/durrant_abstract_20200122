An introduction to Docker and how it might be used by the WAVEWATCH III community

Docker is lightweight, easy to use virtualization environment to deliver software in packages called containers. 
Containers are isolated from one another as well as the host OS and bundle their own software, 
libraries and configuration files. Containers offer some compelling features in the context of both development 
environments and operational deployment. Tom will give a brief overview of how Ocean Numerical currently uses Docker, 
and how it might be used in the context of WAVEWATCH III development. 

Ocean Numerical have also developed an open-source python wave spectral processing library that may be of interest 
to this group. Tom will give a brief overview of its features and current development plans.
